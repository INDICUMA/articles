# Phillippine President Rodrigo Duterte has signed an executive order to introduce the use of nuclear power

The Philippines spent $2.3 billion on a 621MWe Westinghouse pressurised water reactor at Bataan.
It was completed in 1984 but was never fuled or comissioned following allegations of financial irregularities and concern about safety.
And it was formally mothballed in 1986

An Internation Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review(INIR) in 2018 had reviews the status of nuclear development in Philippines using Criteria from Phase 1 of the IAEA's Milestone Approach.

In July 2020 Duterte had issued Exeucutive Order No 116 creating inter-agency committee to evaluate and assess the need and viabillity of introducing nuclear power plant into the energy mix
Duterte said nuclear power plant would be tapped as vialbe alternative baseload power source as the Phillippines seeks to retire coal platns to help meet climate target.
